# AERION
AERION - Approach Estimation and Representation of Intent for Operational Navigation is a deep learning trajectory prediction model that supports pilot descent planning and Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) in terminal airspace.

The model is currently under development as part of the master's thesis "Learning Multi-Modal Representations for Aircraft Approach Trajectory Prediction" at the Hasso Plattner Institut (HPI) in Potsdam, in collaboration with the Institute of Flight Guidance at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig.
